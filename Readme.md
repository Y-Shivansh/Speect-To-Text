# Vakya | Speech-to-Text (Frontend)

A small frontend-only application named "Vakya" for speech-to-text functionality.

Notes:

- The frontend code lives in `stt_frontend/`.
- This README is intentionally brief — just the basics to run the frontend.

Quick start (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd stt_frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you want to run only the frontend (no backend required) the app will still try to use any configured API endpoints found in `stt_frontend/config/env.config.js` or `.env` in that folder. Update those if needed.

The env.config.js is already provided to structure the application better, So if you want to have seperate backend using open source tools like sarvam for conversions, you can easily do that.

Enjoy - Vakya!
